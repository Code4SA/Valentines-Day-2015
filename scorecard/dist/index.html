		<h1 class="article-headline">Did the ANC bulldoze the NCOP?</h1>
		<p class="article-teaser">The DA has claimed the controversial PSIRA Amendment Bill, aimed at placing stricter regulations on the private security sector, was bulldozed past the NCOP. With the President's office yet to sign the Bill almost two years after it was passed by Parliament, is it fair to say it was too hastily approved? And, if so, why?</p>
		<div class="article-content">
			<p>Back in March 2014, the DA made the following <a href="https://www.da.org.za/2014/03/psira-bill-anc-undermining-parliamentary-processes-in-ncop/">statement</a> regarding the Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority (PSIRA) Amendment Bill,</p>
			<blockquote>President Jacob Zuma’s ANC is hell-bent on bulldozing through job-killing Bills in the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) ahead of the elections. In doing so, they are undermining the very clearly set out processes that exist to ensure proper consideration of draft legislation in the NCOP House of Parliament.</blockquote>
			<p>The NCOP is one of the two Houses of Parliament. It is constitutionally mandated to ensure that provincial interests are taken into account within the larger national sphere of government.</p>
			<p>Money has been the hottest point of contention around the PSIRA Bill, which stipulates that security businesses need to be at least 51% South African owned.</p>
			<p>The Bill also covers poor compliance with codes of conduct, criminality within the sector, and the misuse of firearms. It, slightly scarily (if not a tad laden with hyperbolic paranoia), also raises the issue of national security being compromised by the sector's potential for harbouring hired militia, who may serve interests other than that of the elected government. Real or not, all of these issues seem to be very much secondary to the curtailment of foreign investment.</p>
			<p>Damages to foreign investment, job loss, and the alleged reduction of the industry's helping hand to an overstretched SAPS can be debated in many ways, especially when placed within the context of the government’s "<a href="https://pmg.org.za/committee-meeting/16859/">strategic plan to build a development state</a>" that is less dependant on foreign-owned interests.</p>
			<p>That aside, did the ANC really bulldoze this Bill past the NCOP? Or, are there other factors at play, especially considering the fact that <a href="https://pmg.org.za/bill/133/">President Zuma has yet to sign the Bill</a> almost two years later? Can the lack of proper consideration by the NCOP committee, in reality, be put down to faulty – or otherwise unavoidably limited – mechanisms within our country's bureaucracy?</p>
			<p>Granted, at the heart of the <a href="https://www.da.org.za/2014/03/psira-bill-anc-undermining-parliamentary-processes-in-ncop/">DA's claim</a> is that the ANC used its majority presence in parliament "to waive the three day rule, which requires three days to pass between a Bill’s finalisation in committee and its consideration by the council in order for all members of the NCOP to review the committee's work and before voting on it".</p>
			<p>This does indeed point to some form of bulldozing. However, the Bill was first presented to the <em>NCOP Security and Justice Committee</em> for review on the 5th of February 2014, and then was passed by the NCOP a month later. Surely such a contentious bill should have been given more attention during that month by all NCOP members without necessarily having to rely on the three day rule?</p>
			<h2>NCOP committee attendance</h2>
			<p>Seeing as NCOP committee members are mandated with giving proper consideration of draft legislation to make sure it adequately accounts for provincial interests, attendance of these members at committee meetings should be seen as paramount to fulfilling said consideration. Their attendance is also pertinent to the DA's claim that the PSIRA Bill was rushed past them between the 5th of February and the 4th of March that year.</p>
			<p>Below are the attendance records of all NCOP members around the time<sup>(1)</sup> of this Bill's passing through Parliament:</p>
			<div class="percentage-bar-scale">
				<span class="percentage-bar-scale-label">Total NCOP meetings</span>
			</div>
			<div class="percentage-bar">
				<div class="percentage-bar-binary-positive" style="width:57%; height:57%;">
					<div class="percentage-bar-label">57% Present</div>
				</div>
				<div class="percentage-bar-binary-negative" style="width:31%; height:31%;">
					<div class="percentage-bar-label">31% Absent<sup class="small">(2)</sup></div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="caption">Figure A: Total NCOP attendance records, with 13% falling under "Unknown" in grey.</p>
			<p>The lack of attendance is concerning, in that only just over half of all NCOP meetings are properly attended by the relevant committee members. The unaccounted 13% of neither absent or present (in grey) are attendance records that were marked as "Unknown".</p>
			<h2>Scheduling conflicts for NCOP members</h2>
			<p>Before bemoaning the tardiness of committee members, it is important to note that it is regularly impossible for a member to be in attendance because they may belong to more than one committee. Meetings for different committees are often scheduled at the same time, or overlap significantly.</p>
			<p>If all cases where NCOP members are expected to attend meetings with date and start times that don't differ more than 30 minutes are deemed to be conflicting, then a huge 61% of NCOP meetings cannot be properly attended by all their relevant NCOP members due to scheduling conflicts.</p>
			<div class="percentage-bar-scale">
				<span class="percentage-bar-scale-label">Total NCOP meetings</span>
			</div>
			<div class="percentage-bar">
				<div class="percentage-bar-binary-negative" style="width:61%; height:61%;">
					<div class="percentage-bar-label">61% of meetings have schedule conflicts</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="caption">Figure B: Meetings that cannot be attended due to schedule conflicts (conflict = where a NCOP member is expected to attend two or more meetings starting within 30 minutes or less of each other).</p>
			<p>Although the above percentage may provide a fairer understanding of absenteeism, showing that members aren't necessarily at fault, there is a resulting discrepancy between members being reported as "Present" and the inability for members to be in two places at once.</p>
			<p>One could infer that a significant proportion (or all) of the "Unknown" records are in all likelihood instances of absenteeism. But that still wouldn't correct the discrepancy as demonstrated by the orange overlap below:</p>
			<div class="percentage-bar-scale">
				<span class="percentage-bar-scale-label">Total NCOP meetings</span>
			</div>
			<div class="percentage-bar">
				<div class="percentage-bar-binary-positive" style="width:57%; height:57%;"></div>
				<div class="percentage-bar-binary-negative" style="width:31%; height:31%;"></div>
			</div>
			<div class="percentage-bar percentage-bar-overlay">
				<div class="percentage-bar-binary-negative" style="width:61%; height:61%;"></div>
			</div>
			<p class="caption">Figure C: Figure A and B overlaid to show attendance discrepancy of 18% in orange, where the green of 57% "Present" instances clashes with the red of 61% of meetings that can't be attended due to schedule conflicts. This discrepancy is evident even after ascribing all 13% of "Unknown" records to absenteeism, as demonstrated by the resulting pink section where "Unknown" records (grey in Figure A) are absorbed by the schedule-conflicting red.</p>
			<p>Either current assumptions around date and time conflicts in the data are not a correct reflection of what happens in reality, or some records of "Present" simply aren't true. This is where the value of combining qualitative data with quantitative data would come in handy.</p>
			<p>Seeing as I don't have reliable qualitative data about how meetings are run <em>de facto</em>, let's withdraw the original assumption of 30 minutes or less being tantamount to a schedule conflict, and instead only class meetings scheduled exactly at the same time as conflicts:</p>
			<div class="percentage-bar-scale">
				<span class="percentage-bar-scale-label">Total NCOP meetings</span>
			</div>
			<div class="percentage-bar">
				<div class="percentage-bar-binary-negative" style="width:27%; height:27%;">
					<div class="percentage-bar-label">27% schedule conflicts</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="caption">Figure D: A stricter of definition of schedule conflicts results in 27% of NCOP meetings being deemed unable to be fully attended by all of the relevant NCOP committee members.</p>
			<p>This stricter definition does now make the overall attendance records shown in Figure A possible:</p>
			<div class="percentage-bar-scale">
				<span class="percentage-bar-scale-label">Total NCOP meetings</span>
			</div>
			<div class="percentage-bar">
				<div class="percentage-bar-binary-positive" style="width:57%; height:57%;"></div>
				<div class="percentage-bar-binary-negative" style="width:31%; height:31%;"></div>
			</div>
			<div class="percentage-bar percentage-bar-overlay">
				<div class="percentage-bar-binary-negative" style="width:27%; height:27%;"></div>
			</div>
			<p class="caption">Figure E: Figure A and D overlaid, no longer showing any discernible or problematic discrepancy. Only a very small amount of absenteeism isn't the result of schedule conflicts (seen in pink), upholding the original point that members are not predominantly at fault for their own tardiness.</p>
			<p>There are two possible conclusions that could be made from this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>A significant number of "Present" records simply aren't true (see Figures B and C), meaning <em>de facto</em> absenteeism is even higher than recorded.</li>
				<li>Or, using our stricter definition of conflicts (see Figures D and E), meetings are short enough for members to take part in two or more closely-scheduled meetings regardless of those meetings starting just a few minutes apart. These meetings would have to be very short indeed, as start times are only differ between 10 and 30 minutes for all NCOP committees.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Both these conclusions are equally worrying. Such a tight schedule in conjunction with the distribution of responsibilities per committee member across different committees could be argued to result in either a significant amount of total absenteeism (point 1) and/or incredibly short and distracted deliberations (point 2).</p>
			<p>Either way, both conclusions would surely place doubts on NCOP member efficacy in adequately considering far-reaching legislation put before them.</p>
			<h2>Lack of inter-NCOP collaboration</h2>
			<p>For the sake of argument let's assume the date and start time data is correct and that meetings occur in different venues within Parliament. In addition to the scheduling concerns on an individual committee member level, meeting schedules also throw into doubt whether proper inter-NCOP collaboration can occur in the unavoidable event of intersecting mandates.</p>
			<p>Because the PSIRA falls under security and policing, it was handed over specifically to the <em>NCOP Security and Justice Committee</em>. Although seemingly the most appropriate committee to deal with this Bill, it does ignore the main tension surrounding it – that the stipulation of 51% South African ownership would negatively affect foreign investment and in turn affect employment prospects for many South Africans involved in the private security sector. As such, would it not also be relevant to the <em>NCOP Economic and Business Development Committee</em>? What about <em>NCOP Trade and International Relations</em>? Or <em>NCOP Finance</em>?</p>
			<p>The way in which meetings are scheduled makes it highly unlikely for more than one committee to deliberate over a new piece of legislation, even though that legislation may have consequences far beyond a single committee's narrow-focused mandate. As legislative arbiters whose decisions impact hugely on the lives of millions of people, is simply reading the minutes of poorly attended deliberations after they've already occurred sufficient in fulfilling the NCOP's underlying purpose?</p>
			<p>The scheduling viewer below allows you to see how members attending a specific NCOP meeting will be unable to attend other NCOP meetings (and vice versa). Remember, <em>all</em> NCOP members need to vote on legislation regardless of it being, or not being, presented to one of their specific committees.</p>

			<p>However, Schedule A above is using a the strict definition of a meeting conflict: date and start times that match exactly.

			<p>This should be indicative of how limited NCOP members involvement may be in other NCOP meetings – an involvement which should function not only to inform their own future vote, but also to play an informative role in other members' votes.</p>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>The value of the three day rule, whose waiving antagonised the DA, is a lot more understandable in light of these scheduling concerns. That said, committee member absenteeism or rushed deliberations, combined with the siloed assignment of legislation to specific committees, does fall noticeably short in giving NCOP members the means to properly deliberate and vote on new legislation (regardless of the three day rule).</p>
			<p>So, bulldozed by the ANC or not, there are perhaps bigger concerns around NCOP active attendance and inter-NCOP committee collaboration. Could this partly explain why the PSIRA Amendment Bill remains unsigned by the President? Is the President's office being forced to consider issues around the Bill that the NCOP failed to do itself in any meaningful and informed way due to problematic bureaucratic logistics?</p>
			<h4>Notes</h4>
			<ol class="list-silent small">
				<li>(1). Granted, the time period included in the data versus the time period around which the NCOP passed the PSIRA Amendment Bill is off by amount 3 months. That, and I have no qualitative data about how meeting schedules are ostensible changed when or if matters needing more consideration are put before them. However, seeing as I only really have the data provided, I'm just going to forge ahead in spite of these things simply for the sake of this exercise.</li>
				<li>(2). This percentage includes all records of members who were not at all present (with and without apologies), arrived late, left early, or arrived late <em>and</em> left early. Even though there are zero recordings of only partially present NCOP members (ie late comers and early leavers), thus rendering them irrelevant, you can view a more detailed breakdown of the attendance records below:</li>
