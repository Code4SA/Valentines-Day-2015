    <h1>Love horoscope: let the data speak</h1>
    <div class="col-md-12">
      MIT performed a long-term study on the factors influencing happiness.
      They tracked X people over 70+ years, tracking the many factors of their lives.
      What they found spoke clear: the very most important predictor of contentment
      with life and health are RELATIONSHIPS. That includes love relationships
      Last year we wrote about:...
      This year's message is more upbeat.
      The STATSSA data on Civil Marriages registered in 2014 has just been released
      and with it, the number of marriages and ages of the spouses that decided
      to take this 'the big step'.

      The data is clear about one thing: love has no age. It is heartwarming
      to see people born in the first quarter of last centure tyng the knots.
      If you were wondering
      what age group people of your own age were marrying with, look no further.
      <br>
      By the same token, it gives an estimate of your own chances of marrying a spouse of a certain age.
      We invite you to discover the data-driven love horoscope: based on number, not stars.

      How to play?
      Choose your gender (WOMEN- left side, MAN- right side) and age range.
      E.g. if you are a FEMALE of 26 you hover over the (25-30) category in the LEFT column.
